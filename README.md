## Description
<p>'World War 3' will be a 2D platformer game developed in Java, which represents a war between humans and robots. The game will involve homeowners who use a variety of humans to prevent an army of robots from entering their houses and kill all human beings. In this game the house which is tried to be protected from robots represents the Earth. There will be different kinds of humans and robots. They will differ from each other in terms of their weapons, healths and damages. The game will consist of multiple levels.</p>
<p>We get inspired from the game named 'Plants vs. Zombies' which is similar to our game. There are plants and zombies instead of humans and robots.</p>
